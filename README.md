INTERVIEW SCHEDULER APP
=========

This was an introduction to the React project, so the main goal was the learning itself. The most challenging part was to follow ornated instructions and make my best guess on what exactly is required and how it should look like. That was huge chunk of work, I guess :)
However, I did enjoy working with React, and I commit to making this little challenge the first step into this blessed universe of React.
